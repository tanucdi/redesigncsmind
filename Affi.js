              <p>My association with Dr. P K Chande goes back more than 25 years ago. We first met in a conference he was organizing. At that time he was the director of the well-known institute called SGITS, Indore. He invited me to give a talk on Database systems. It was a successful event and since then we kept in touch through email, Skype and through other communication channels. I was impressed with his innovative ideas on information management discipline which led to tighter collaboration. This resulted in offering joint workshops and seminars on mobility, databases, etc. I visited him at several occasions and we travelled together to universities and companies who invited us to organize academic events. Dr. Chande did not remain confined to our collaboration, he diversified his activities in administration, software development, running a number of academic institutes and universities very successfully without slowing down in research and development work. He is a first class innovator. Recently he is focusing in AI and to this end, he is building a highly useful web-based system called CSMIND. It is a wonderful system which provides opportunities to young scientists, upcoming industries, universities, teachers, educationists, etc., to materialize their inventions, products innovations, etc., and work with them to create systems for the future. The world, especially, Hindustan needs such system to lead many countries in the field of education, research and development. I encourage our young generations and established researchers to connect with CSMIND to make our country a leader in technology. I am happy to be in the vicinity of Dr. Chande’s sphere of control.

              <p>Professor Chande has been my first mentor right from the days I was an engineering student. When I first came in touch with him I wanted to write an article on superconductivity for a national contest. Someone suggested me to get in touch with him. I wondered, “How can a Professor of Computer Engineering and Electronics” guide me on superconductivity. 
I was so wrong. He not only guided me helped me re-write the draft that I went with and the final essay was way valuable in fact, so valuable that it got me a national prize. Since then, I worked for several years on several research projects and when I moved on to the corporate world he motivated me to make the change.
He has been a role model for many youths for research, teaching and professional growth. I feel that such mentors are available to all youth and CSMIND will bridge this gap for the youths.  </p>
